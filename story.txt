There once was a fuzzy coconut that loved to eat lemon pie. The coconut lived in Aruba (because that is where coconuts live). 
One day he wanted to make lemon pie himself. As he read the ingredient list, he was horrified. He couldn't believe it. In order to make the lemon
pie he would have to kill one of this own. He needed the coconut water in the recipe. There was no way to get the water without killing the coconut.
