There once was a fuzzy coconut that loved to eat lemon pie. The coconut lived in Aruba (because that is where coconuts live). 
One day he wanted to make lemon pie himself. As he read the ingredient list, he was horrified. HE WAS EATING HIS OWN FRIENDS! The crust is made with 
coconut oil. It was a classic tale of forced cannibalism.
