There once was a fuzzy coconut that loved to eat lemon pie. The coconut lived in Aruba (because that is where coconuts live). 
One day he wanted to make lemon pie himself. As he read the ingredient list, he was horrified. He couldn't believe it. In order to make the lemon
pie he would have to kill one of this own. He needed the coconut water in the recipe. There was no way to get the water without killing the coconut.
He lived in despair for weeks; longing for lemon pie but not willing to sacrifice one of his own. One day, however, while browsing the library, he
discovered a book titled "Coconut Substitution Guide." He excitedly took the book off the shelf and begin reading. He learned that brazil nuts and
macademia nuts make good substitutions for coconut due to their nutty flavor. So it is all good for the fuzzy coconut. No more forced cannibalism for his favorite food! Yay! :)
